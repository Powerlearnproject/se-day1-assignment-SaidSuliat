List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several distinct phases that guide the development of software applications from inception to deployment and maintenance. Here’s a brief explanation of each phase:

**1. Planning:** This initial phase involves defining the scope and objectives of the project. Stakeholders identify the requirements, assess feasibility, and allocate resources. A project plan is created, outlining timelines, budgets, and key deliverables.

**2. Requirements Analysis:** In this phase, detailed requirements are gathered from stakeholders and users. This involves understanding what the software needs to accomplish and documenting functional and non-functional requirements. This phase is crucial for ensuring that the final product meets user expectations.

**3. Design:** The design phase translates the requirements into a blueprint for the software. This includes architectural design, user interface design, and database design. The goal is to create a detailed specification that guides developers in building the software.

**4. Implementation (or Coding):** During this phase, developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This involves programming, integrating various components, and ensuring that the software functions as intended. Code reviews and version control practices are often employed to maintain quality.

**5. Testing:** After implementation, the software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix defects. Various testing methods, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing, are employed to ensure that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of critical bugs.

**6. Deployment:** Once testing is complete and the software is deemed ready, it is deployed to the production environment. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and user training. Depending on the project, deployment can be done in stages or all at once.

**7. Maintenance:** After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for issues and updated as necessary. This includes fixing bugs, implementing enhancements, and ensuring compatibility with new technologies. Maintenance is an ongoing process that ensures the software remains functional and relevant over time.

These phases provide a structured approach to software development, helping teams manage complexity and deliver high-quality software that meets user needs.
